I wake up early in the morning, ready to start my day
Got my eyes on the prize, gotta keep it that way
I'm focused on my goals, ain't no time to play
Got a winning mentality, I'm built that way
Winning, winning, that's all I know
I grind hard, put on a show
I won't stop, I won't slow
I'm a champion, that's just how I flow
Every challenge that I ace,
I conquer it with ease
I've got the heart of a lion,
I'm the king of the beast
I put in the work, no shortcuts or cheats
I'm a true winner, no defeat
Winning, winning, that's all I know
I grind hard, put on a show
I won't stop, I won't slow
I'm a champion, that's just how I flow
My opponents better watch out,
'cause I'm coming for the crown
I've got the drive and the hunger,
I won't back down I stay on top of my game, no room for a letdown
I'm a winner, I wear that like a crown
Winning, winning, that's all I know
I grind hard, put on a show
I won't stop, I won't slow
I'm a champion, that's just how I flow
Outro: I'm a winner, that's a fact won't let anyone hold me back I'll keep on winning, that's my pact I'm unstoppable, that's how I act.
